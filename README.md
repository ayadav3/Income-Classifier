Income-Classifier
=================

A project to solve a binary classification problem using Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests and Decision Trees.

The project aims to find the algorithm which best classifies the income level of a person based on about 40 variables from the US census data.

It is to be noted that the dataset is highly unbalanced and data preprocessing is required before applying the algorithms from sklearn.

DataSet
--------------------
This data set contains weighted census data extracted from the 1994 and 1995 current population surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
